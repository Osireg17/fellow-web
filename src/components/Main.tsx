            Christian community is meant to be so much deeper than interactions on social media, or even a shared interest. The old-fashioned word often used to describe Christian community is "fellowship". At its core, fellowship speaks of a shared, common life. It's the practice of making real friends! Fellowship invloves genuine connections, deep relationships
            sacrificial giving and open-handed receiving. It's a safe space for laughter and tears. Making good friends is key for dealing with life's challenges. It's not a "nice to have", but a "must have"
